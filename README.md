Thanks for stopping by! This is the source code for Preston So's [personal site](https://preston.so), powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org), and [Oracle Content and Experience](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/content-and-experience).

## Getting started

1.  **Install Gatsby CLI.**

    Ensure you have Gatsby CLI installed globally. You'll also need [Node.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/).

    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

    You can run `gatsby --help` to see available commands and ensure Gatsby CLI is installed correctly.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site's root directory and boot it up!

    ```sh
    cd preston-so/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1.  **Prepare a build and serve.**

    You can prepare a production-ready build and serve it in your browser:

    ```sh
    gatsby build && gatsby serve
    ```

## Next steps for preston.so

- Refactor use of `background-image` property to use `gatsby-image` instead, for both accessibility and performance reasons.
- Componentize CSS to be less global in order to improve performance.
- Implement `gatsby-plugin-intl` (see `feat/intl` branch).

## More about Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
